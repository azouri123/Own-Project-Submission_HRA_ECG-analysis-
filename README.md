# Heart_failure_Prediction_HRA

This repo was created to share files of the final assignment of the Harvardx: PH125.9x: Data Science_ Capstone module.

The objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques that go beyond standard linear regression to train different algorithms in order to predict heart failure based on given variables. 

The algorithms were trained and tested on a dataset found on Kaggle, for convenience, it is uploaded in this repo.

This repo includes a script file (.R) which provides all of the code used for the exploratory analyses as well as for the development, testing, and presentation of the results from each of the models used, a markdown file (.Rmd), the final report (.pdf) that it was used to generate, and the data set (.csv).
