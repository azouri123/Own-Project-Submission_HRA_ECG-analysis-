# ECG-analysis_HRA

This repo was created to share files of the final assignment of the Harvardx: PH125.9x: Data Science_ Capstone module.

The objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques that go beyond standard linear regression to train different algorithms in order to predict heart failure based on given variables. 

This repo includes a script file (.R) which provides all of the code used for the exploratory analyses as well as for the development, testing, and presentation of the results from each of the models used, a markdown file (.Rmd) and the final report (.pdf)
